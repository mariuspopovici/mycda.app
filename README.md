## Configuration

In order to use the location based weather data pull you need to configure your app instance to connect to the OpenWeatherMap API. To do so follow these simple steps:

- Sample application configuration files are provided in the _config_ folder. Rename _sample.dev.env.js_ to _dev.env.js_ and _sample.prod.env.js_ to _prod.env.js_.
- Sign up for a free **OpenWeatherMap** account at https://openweathermap.org/api
- Once your account is set up, go into [API Keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and copy your API key.
- Configure **RhoApp** by editing the _config/prov.env.js_ or _config/dev/env.js_ files and inserting the API key copied in the previous text into the placeholder.
